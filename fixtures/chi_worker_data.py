The process by which bitcoins are created and then used was covered, and some of the shortcomings of the currency was presented - its price can fluctuate in response to bad press, it's attractive to black-market users, and not all companies accept bitcoins. Bitcoin-mining was also explained, helpfully - though I'm not confident that I fully understood it."
